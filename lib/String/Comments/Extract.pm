    // Last comment
    _END_

    my $comments = String::Comments::Extract::C->extract($source)
    # ... returns the following result:

=head1 DESCRIPTION

String::Comments::Extract is a tool for extracting comments from C/C++/JavaScript/Java source. The extractor
is implemented using an actual tokenizer (written in C via XS [adapted from L<JavaScript::Minifier::XS>]). By using
a tokenizer, it can correctly deal with notoriously problematic cases, such as comment-like structures embedded in strings:

    std::cout << "This is not a // real C++ comment " << std::endl
    printf("/* This is not a real C comment */\n");
    # The extractor will ignore both of the above

String::Comments::Extract considers C/C++/JavaScript/Java comment structures the same, so, for now, it doesn't really
matter which method you use (this means it will not complain about C++ style comments in C source).

The language agnostic interface to C/C++/JavaScript/Java comment extractor is accessible via String::Comments::Extract::SlashStar

    # Can handle slash-star (/* */) and slash-slash (//) comments
    String::Comments::Extract::SlashStar->extract
    String::Comments::Extract::SlashStar->collect

=head1 METHODS

=head2 String::Comments::Extract::JavaScript->extract( <source> )

=head2 String::Comments::Extract::CPP->extract( <source> )

=head2 String::Comments::Extract::C->extract( <source> )

=head2 String::Comments::Extract::SlashStar->extract( <source> )

Returns a string representing the comments in <source>

Comment delimeters ( C</* */ //> ) are left in as-is

Whitespace of <source> is otherwise preserved, so you'll probably have to do some post-processing to get rid of some cruft.

=head2 String::Comments::Extract::JavaScript->collect( <source> )

=head2 String::Comments::Extract::CPP->collect( <source> )

=head2 String::Comments::Extract::C->collect( <source> )

=head2 String::Comments::Extract::SlashStar->collect( <source> )

Returns a list containing an item for each block- or line-comment in <source>

Comment delimeters ( C</* */ //> ) around the comment are removed

Whitespace outside of comments may not be preserved exactly
